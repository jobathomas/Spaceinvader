In this project, I aim to build a 2D, space-shooter game, primarily using the pygame library.
The player must destroy incoming meteorites while also dodging projectiles from alien spaceships. The player's spacecraft also gradually increases in speed. 
This project applies concepts of object oriented programming (OOP) and Sprite animation.
